# Phase space reconstruction of financial data
### Overview
In this project we attempt to reconstruct the phase space of the ```AAPL``` stock based on Doyne Farmer's famous paper [Geometry from a Time Series](https://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/Geometry%20from%20a%20Time%20Series.pdf).<br>
Namely, any time series $\\{x_i\\}$ may be restructured as $d$-dimensional vectors of the form 
<p align="center">
$\vec{x_i} = (^1x_i, ^2x_{i+\tau}, ..., ^dx_{i+(d-1)\cdot\tau})$
</p>

where _d_ is the embedding dimension of the phase space and $\tau$ is the time delay parameter.

Specifically, we follow the steps below:
1. pull historical data of the selected stock using the [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) package
1. apply a low-pass Butterworth filter on the data, in order to extract the low-frequency signal
1. plot the stock time-series **
1. plot the $3$-dimensional ($d = 3$) reconstructed phase space of the time-series ** <br>
\** _applied to both initial and filtered time series_

### Input parameters
-  __TICKER_SYMBOL__ (_string_):= ticker symbol of selected stock
-  __START_DATE__ (_string_):= start date of historical data in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
-  __END_DATE__ (_string_):= end date of historical data in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
-  __CUTOFF_FREQ__ (_float_):= cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter
-  __SAMPLE_RATE__ (_float_):= sampling rate of the input data used for the low-pass filter
-  __ORDER__ (_int_):= order of the Butterworth low-pass filter
-  __TIME_DELAY_PARAMETER__ (_int_):= time delay parameter of the phase space embedding
